<h1>Western Water - Introduction</h1>

        <p>Watern Water does not include water from desalination plants, ground water, or water pulled directly from rivers
        Instead it focuses on water stored in reservoirs.</p>
        <p>Data does not include every reservoir in California. Data for some reservoirs was not available for various reasons; mainly due to
            an inability to scrape data or determine a reservoir's capacity. Nor is water from Colorado river reservoirs, which provides
            water to much of southern California, as it's difficult
            to quantify how much water in each reservoir: Havasu, Mead and Powell belongs to California. The Colorado River
            Compact guarantees California 4,000,000 acre feet a year. So
            you can spread it among the Colorado River reservoirs however you see fit. If there
            is a shortfall in available water  in the river California's water rights trump Arizona's.</p>
        <p>Texas reservoir data should be complete. A handful of reservoirs in Texas are shared with other states or countries, with
        the water split as a percentage between the agreement partners.</p>
