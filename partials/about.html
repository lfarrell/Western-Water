<h1>Western Water - Introduction</h1>

        <p>Watern Water does not include water from desalination plants, ground water, or water pulled directly from rivers
        Instead it focuses on water stored in reservoirs.</p>
        <p>Data does not include every reservoir in California. Data for some reservoirs was not available for various reasons; mainly due to
            an inability to scrape data or determine a reservoir's capacity. Nor is water from Colorado river reservoirs, which provides
            water to much of southern California, as it's difficult
            to quantify how much water in each reservoir: Havasu, Mead and Powell, belongs to California, as each
            reservoir lies wholly or in part outside the state. The Colorado River
            Compact guarantees California 4,000,000 acre feet a year. So
            you can spread it among the Colorado River reservoirs however you see fit. If there
            is a shortfall in available water  in the river California's water rights trump Arizona's.</p>
        <p>Texas reservoir data should be complete. A handful of reservoirs in Texas are shared with other states or countries, with
        the water split as a percentage between the agreement partners. The reservoir capacities and volume in the visualization
        are based on Texas' percentages, except as noted below.</p>
        <p>The shared reservoirs are:
            <ul>
                <li>Lake Amistad, shared with Mexico: 56.2% of reservoir belongs to Texas.</li>
                <li>Lake Falcon, shared with Mexico: 58.6% of reservoir belongs to Texas.</li>
                <li>Caddo Lake, shared with Louisiana: 50.0% of reservoir belongs to Texas</li>
                <li>Elephant Butte Lake, shared with Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and the Mexican state of Chihuahua.</li>
                <li>Lake Meredith, shared with New Mexico and Oklahoma: 500,000 acre feet belong to Texas after New Mexico's
                    allotment of 200,000 acre feet are held in Ute Lake. Texas must release water beyond its allotment
                to Oklahoma.</li>
                <li>Lake Texoma, shared with Oklahoma: 50.0% of reservoir belongs to Texas</li>
                <li>Toledo Bend Reservoir, shared with Louisiana: 50.0% of reservoir belongs to Texas</li>
            </ul>
